The second story in "Builders in the Void". Be sure to read the first one beforehand. I don't mean to go heavy on the military side of things, but I had an idea in the shower, and I'm running with it. This is set 96 years after humans get on the Council.

"Humans. For too long your arrogant race has squatted on soil promised to us centuries ago. You challenge our ideals, pillage our enterprises and think yourselves worthy of our respect. Either kneel in servitude or lay down and die."

Admiral James Ryder played the message from the Dracus Hierarchy to the Human Alliance to himself. It was the first thing he did when he awoke every day, now for the last 3 weeks. It helped get his mind in focus, shake off the last vestiges of sleep, and remind him what everyone in his fleet was fighting for.

Though the silence of his cabin implied otherwise, 4th Fleet, headed by the 2 kilometre-long carrier AFS Maxwell, was in the most desperate fight of it's history. A month ago, the Dracus Hierarchy, tired of humanity protecting itself and the other races from dracus "privateers", undermining the dracus slave trade, and generally existing in systems that were set aside for dracus colonists before First Contact, declared vendetta on the human race. The 7 systems on the border with the Hierarchy were overrun, and the second offensive on Alliance Space is ongoing. At least, Ryder thinks it is, comm bouys connecting the system to the outside Galaxy had long been reduced to debris. 4th Fleet is managing the defense here in the Hades system, named for it's hellish red giant. 2 weeks ago, a Hierarchy fleet seven times the size of the 4th arrived in Hades. Such a huge force could only mean one thing. The only way to Darwin, humanity's second-most populated world, from dracus-controled space is through Hades. (Starships need a spell in the magnetic field of a star or planet every time they travel several lightyears, to discharge their drivecores) In short, the dracus have the biggest hammer in the Galaxy, and if Ryder and his humble bunch of warships doesn't take the strike, it'll fall on 5 billion humans.

Trying to push aside thoughts of his baby girl Sam-her obsession with dinosaurs, sharing her toy ship collection with the other kids, how she'll spend the rest of her life in some damned mine if he fails-he brushes out the wrinkles in his uniform and steps out onto the bridge.

"I'll have my chair back, XO" Ryder shoots towards his Executive Officer, Captain Weathers. If this was peacetime, everyone on the deck would be giving him the sharpest salute they could after a graveyard shift, but he had dispensed with some of the formalities when the biggest fight in human history erupted.

"Of course, sir, just keeping it warm." Weathers replies, standing and taking her post at the holomap in the centre of the bridge. Ryder, one who thinks better on his feet than his ass, as he believes himself to be, joins her.

"How's Beta and Gamma looking. It'll soon be our turn in the fire." the Admiral inquires. That sentence was making it's way into his everyday vocabulary.

Against a big enough force, standard doctrine wasn't going to cut it. Even with all the advantages an Alliance ship had over it's more crudely-made Hierarchy opposite number, shear numbers put the odds in the Hierarchy's favor. When the enemy arrived in Hades, the shipboard AI's in the 4th cooperated for 30 seconds in simulating a conventional fight between the fleet and their new dracus friends, and concluded that they would survive for 23 minutes. In what was possibly the darkest minute of his life, Ryder suddenly remembered a school lesson from when he was 14 years old.

Every time someone on a ship lighted a thruster, fired a cannon, or turned on the coffee machine, they generate heat, and that heat, if it is to not set the interior on fire, has to be radiated away. In the stress of combat, warships always generate heat at a greater rate than they can dissipate, but can store it in heatsinks, to be released when the battle is over. This puts a time limit on conventional battles, a matter of hours at most.

Ryder's great idea was to split the fleet into 3 groups, Alpha, Beta and Gamma, with 2 performing constant hit-and-run attacks while the other rested and vented heat. The effect on the dracus was similar to rain on a mountain-to begin with, they were barely taking a dent, and the 4th couldn't get close enough to do real damage. Ryder allows himself a quick smirk on the expense of his furry counterpart on the Hierarchy fleet-he probably had nothing to worry about on the first day, 'These humans will soon be whittled down to nothing!', but as the constant firing and absorbing and evading sets in, after a few days the bridge must've gotten a little toasty. Performance on their part fell sharply around day 8 (the AI's concluded that the Hierarchy's combat stims had just ran out, and the total inability to sleep in a dry-heat is universal) and now, day 14, the main guns on their dreadnoughts could only fire once a minute, not once every five seconds, any faster would kill the crews. Ryder could right know on the holomap see basic tactical errors that could probably be chalked-up to heatstroke.

Now, they were taking out bigger chunks of the enemy at a time. A destroyer would make a fly-by, pound a cruiser pack to hell, then fly back out. A fighter squadron, full of rested pilots and tip-top "planes" would spin circles around a capital's overworked screening, and break it's back with a torpedo run. Yesterday, a tiny frigate, AFS Alamein, under Captain Rogers, managed to dive deep into the fleet, get right next to the Hierarchy supercarrier, and fired a tungsten "buckshot" round into the hanger, then fucked off back to friendly space. Video of the carrier silently disintegrating sent the whole bridge into cheers. Ryder made a note to buy Rogers a beer when this was over.

While the 4th was down to 80% strength, the dracus had lost a half of what they brought in. Ryder couldn't help but feel hopeful. 'The crews are getting warm meals and enough sleep, and the air is a refreshing 293°K. Another week like this, and we may just--'

"Sir! We're reading thousands of new signatures entering the system! They don't have Alliance sensor flags!" Comm Specialist Stone bellowed across the bridge, hinting at Ryder's worst fears. If this was dracnus reinforcements, then they're all as good as dead. The 4th has no ships in reserve. Even with the first wave in the state it is, the both of them would stretch the humans too thin. Getting steamrolled was a possibility Ryder accepted when he decided to stay in Hades and hold the ground, but that didn't make it any less embarrassing. "They're hailing us! They're using Alliance frequencies!" Stone announced, this time with a notably less heavy tone.

Ryder, being who he is, factored in the possibility that the Hierarchy pried those frequencies from the glassed ruins of an Alliance base, and kept scowling. Reinforcements would have friendly flags, and the Alliance couldn't possibly have this many ships to spare for the counteroffensive. At worst, this was a dracus Admiral calling in to gloat about his inevitable victory.

"Put it on-screen." Ryder growled with all the steely resolve he could muster. 'Might as well give the Galaxy a few more examples of uncut human snark before obliteration.'

What came onto the main screen at the front of the bridge sent gasps around the crew. The scaly green skin of a remlyn was sporting the battle dress and warpaint of an Admiral, a distinguished one at that. It's sharp gaze met Ryder's, and gave a salute. "Admiral Ryder, this is Admiral Tomnbey, of the Council Expeditionary Fleet, here to provide assistance. We believe you've been cut off from communications for the past {14 Earth days}, so I'll explain: The Council threw out the dracus in response to their war on you, and the remaining members has mobilized to defend the Alliance. My fleet has been sent here to deal with the dracus presence in Hades. Truth be told, we didn't expect so many of you to be alive, and so many of them... not."

Few things could stun Ryder, one of them being 'everyone in the damn Galaxy rushing to war against the single largest military power, just to save the clever suitmonkeys'. "We certainly appreciate the help, Admiral, but why? There's nothing saying the other Council races must go to war for us."

The muscles in Tomnbey's face twitched in such a way as to produce a grin. "I'm speaking from personal experience here-my brother would be in chains right now if there wasn't a human escort to save his trading convoy from dracus slavers. You humans are too good for us to let you die. We enter firing range in {30 seconds}."

"Orders, Admiral?" Ryder turned to meet Captain Weathers. She was standing tall and straight, eyes alert and her mouth trying desperately to bury a smile, the sort of smile someone wears just before destroying something. Ryder couldn't help but join in. "Beta group is to disengage, their shift has just ended, tell them to sit back and enjoy the fireworks." Ryder looks over at his chair, and marches to his post. As he sits down, he taps out a command to activate the fleet-wide intercom.

"All ships, this is Admiral Ryder. Just now, the rest of Galaxy has sent their finest warriors to our space, to lend us a little help in our pest control." That earned a cheer from the bridge. "For two weeks, we were outgunned and outnumbered, having to pull every trick in the book to survive. Now, our enemies are tired, terrified and most likely medium rare." This time, a devilish chuckle. "We now mount one mighty push to free Hades from these monsters, and tomorrow, we take back Tesla, then Athens, Baikonur, Chang'e, Valhalla, Sīmā and Jigoku! Alpha group, engage!"

And on that day, the Hierarchy Fleet, the largest hammer in the Galaxy, falls.

Anyone can employ firepower, agility or stealth to win a battle, but leave it to the humans to use the Laws of Thermodynamics. Thanks for reading!
